# Welcome to the Data Analytics Folder

**Here is a brief description of each model available in this folder:**

**_1. CO2 Emission Predictor:_**
This project aims to predict the CO2 emission of a car based on its features such as engine size, fuel consumption, and transmission type. The project uses a regression model to make predictions and is built using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

**_2. Medical Cost Prediction:_**
This project aims to predict the medical costs of patients based on features like age, gender, BMI, and smoking habits. The project uses a regression model to make predictions and is built using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

**_3. Bird Species Prediction:_**
This project aims to predict the species of a bird based on its features like beak length, wingspan, and weight. The project uses a classification model to make predictions and is built using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

**_4. Finding Hot Zone of Terrorism:_**
This project aims to find the hot zones of terrorism by analyzing terrorist attacks around the world. The project uses clustering algorithms like K-Means and DBSCAN to group similar attacks together and identify hot zones. The project is built using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

**_5. Bank Customer Churn Predictor Model:_**
The model is built using H2O AutoML, a powerful automated machine learning library that simplifies the process of training and selecting the best model for a given dataset. We used H2O AutoML to automatically train and select the best model for this dataset. AutoML searches for the best combination of algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance. We used a 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
